# Development Process


1. Define DAO interface
``` java
public interface EmployeeDAO {
public List<Employee> getEmployees();
}
```

2. Define DAO implementation
``` java
public class EmployeeDAOImpl implements EmployeeDAO {
@Autowired
private SessionFactory sessionFactory;
public List<Employee> getEmployees() {
...
}
}
```
3. Create Employee Service
``` java
@Service
public class EmployeeService{
	
	@Autowired
	private EmployeeDAO employeeDAO;
	
	@Override
	@Transactional
	public List<User> getAllUsers() {
		
		return employeeDAO.getAllEmployes();
	}
```
4. Create Employee Controller
``` java
@Controller
public class EmployeeController {
	@Autowired
	private EmployeeService employeeService;
	

	@RequestMapping("/Users")
	public String listUsers(Model theModel) {
		//calling services
